# Student projects for Foundary-climate

Radar and meteoogy
1. Onboard, teach Git et al
2. Basic Py-ART download and use cookbook. https://projectpythiatutorials.github.io/radar-cookbook/example-workflows/moore-oklahoma-tornado.html
3. Take cookbook and modify for Houson, June 2nd 18UTC 
4. Look at https://projectpythiatutorials.github.io/radar-cookbook/foundations/pyart-gridding.html and make a lat/lon (x/y) grid
5. take areal mean of grid. https://foundations.projectpythia.org/core/xarray/computation-masking.html 
6. Get atmospheric data from ERA5 

ML
1. find a depixelizer example and run it on the example data
2. train depixilaer net on radar data


Workflows
1. set up simple dask cluster on alcf jupyter hub
2. do simple analysis of cmip6 data on alcf using your dask cluster
3. set up bigger cluster using dask job - reach

linked
1. do radar for a decade over houston. pull atmospheric 
2. train network on thetagpu
3. push data (time series of radar + atmos + cmip6) to foundry
